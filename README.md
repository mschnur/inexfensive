# Inexfensive
### Overview
* We have built an easily reproducible, low cost device to monitor and scoring fencing matches.
* Equivalent commercial scoring systems are very expensive, and this prohibitive cost can prevent growth in the fencing community.
* By using easily accessible, low cost components, open-sourcing our code and providing building instructions, others can easily recreate our product. 
* Our ultimate goal is to allow other fencers or small fencing clubs to engage in electric fencing when they did not originally have the financial means.
